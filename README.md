Final Project Plan

The following text describes our initial approach to the final project scene and advanced techniques to be utilized. Note that we may deviate slightly from this depending on time, but intend to meet all requirements specified in FinalProject.pdf. Any deviations from this document will be noted in the project submission. 

Theme

Our theme will be related to camping in the woods. It will be an outdoor theme utilizing trees, fog, and fire. 

Requirements

•	Extruded Geometry Node: Tree (e.g. branches)
•	Additional textures (x3):  Ground, Trees, Tent, Firewood
•	Advanced techniques (x2): Skybox (night sky), Fog, Particle System (fire / campfire)
•	Animation: Particle System (fire / campfire)

Overall Scene

The basic environment will consist of two items: a night sky skybox and a textured unit square representing the ground. To add to this, we will have a fire pit constructed of a firewood object and a fire particle system. Additionally, trees will be placed throughout the scene’s background. To finalize the scene, a fog effect will be added. 

Lighting will consist of the moon (directional light), fire (emission or point), and a lamp (point). The user will be able to navigate the scene utilizing a spotlight that may be enabled / disabled at runtime. 

Development Approach

We will be utilizing the Module11Lab reference as a starting point. Anything else will be added onto this. For communication, we’re primarily using email with occasional Skype calls as needed. Collaboration will consist of utilizing an online version control system such as Github or Bitbucket. Work will be divided in a way that is agreed on by both members of our group.
